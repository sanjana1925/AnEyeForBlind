The integration of YOLOv5 for object detection, EfficientNet for scene recognition,
and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality demonstrates the capability of real-time
computer vision applications to provide both visual and auditory feedback. The system
successfully identifies objects, estimates distances, and recognizes scenes in a live video
feed, making it a valuable tool for enhancing situational awareness and interaction. The
real-time updates and continuous processing ensure a dynamic and responsive experience,
highlighting the potential of combining advanced machine learning models and practical
applications in a single pipeline.
